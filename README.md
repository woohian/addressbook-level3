# AddressBook (Level 3)

<img src="doc/images/Ui.png">

* This is a CLI (Command Line Interface) Address Book application **written in OOP fashion**. It has a very basic GUI.
* It is a Java sample application intended for students learning Software Engineering while using Java as 
  the main programming language. 
* It provides a **reasonably well-written** code example that is **significantly bigger** than what students 
  usually write in data structure modules. 
  
**What's different from level 2**

* A simple GUI added to replace the Text UI.
* A `Logic` class added together with a `LogicTest` class.
* Appendices added to [Developer Guide](doc/DeveloperGuide.md).
